//! Reload `config.toml` on `SIGHUP`, so external tools (e.g. a settings GUI)
//! can apply changes without the user pressing the `restart` keybinding.
//!
//! Penrose's event loop blocks on the X connection, so a signal alone can't
//! reach it. Three small pieces cooperate instead:
//!
//! 1. the `SIGHUP` handler only flips an atomic flag (the only thing that is
//!    async-signal-safe to do there);
//! 2. a watcher thread notices the flag and touches a property on the root
//!    window through its own X connection, which wakes the event loop with a
//!    `PropertyNotify` (penrose selects `PROPERTY_CHANGE` on the root);
//! 3. an event hook sees the flag on that event and runs the very same
//!    `restart` the `M-S-r` keybinding does, so `main` re-execs pwm in place.
//!
//! The handler is a plain function, not a blocked signal mask, on purpose: a
//! blocked `SIGHUP` would be inherited by every program pwm spawns.
